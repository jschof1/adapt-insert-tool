# Adapt Id pair Insertion Tool
This tool allows you to insert new components that may sit alongside eachother inside an Adapt block.

Using this tool you should be able to copy and paste components into their required blocks.

In order to copy and paste blocks without `Id/_parentId` errors I use the [Increment Selection](https://github.com/albymor/Increment-Selection) tool.
